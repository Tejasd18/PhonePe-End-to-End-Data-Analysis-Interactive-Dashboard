## Title
PhonePe – End to End Data Analysis using Power BI

## Problem Statement
The rapid growth of digital payment platforms like PhonePe has resulted in massive volumes of transaction data being generated daily. However, raw data alone does not provide actionable insights unless it is transformed into meaningful visualizations.

The objective of this project is to design and develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes PhonePe transaction data to:
⦁	Monitor overall transaction performance
⦁	Track service-wise revenue (Insurance, Loans, Money Transfers, Recharge & Bills)
⦁	Identify failed transactions and their root causes
⦁	Detect monthly trends and user behavior patterns
⦁	Assist stakeholders in making data-driven business decisions

The challenge was to turn complex, unstructured transaction data into a **clear, visually interactive, and decision-friendly dashboard.

## Steps Followed & Learning From this project
1. Collected, cleaned, and transformed 10,000+ PhonePe transaction records** using Power Query by removing duplicates, fixing missing values, and standardizing date and amount formats for accurate analysis.
2. Built a structured data model by creating relationships** between Users, Transactions, and Services tables, which improved reporting accuracy and dashboard performance.
3. Developed DAX measures and KPIs** such as Total Transaction Amount, Success Rate (%), Failure Rate (%), and Monthly Growth (%), enhancing data-driven decision-making.
4. Designed a 5-page interactive Power BI dashboard** (Overview, Insurance, Loans, Money Transfer, Recharge & Bills) to visualize service-wise performance and trends.
5. Performed in-depth failure analysis**, identifying top causes of transaction failures and improving understanding of system and user-related issues.
6. Implemented slicers, filters, and navigation buttons** to create an interactive and user-friendly dashboard experience.
7. Strengthened analytical thinking and business insight skills** by converting raw transaction data into meaningful visual stories and actionable recommendations.
